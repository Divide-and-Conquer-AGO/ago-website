The mod focuses on providing players with an immersive and authentic experience while also allowing for complex strategies and deep roleplay.</p><div style=text-align:center class=download-embed><iframe allow=fullscreen; frameborder=0 width=500 height=500 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IyAmjMXOkA?si=scCOw4bnhPWyIQ44"></iframe></div><h3 id=submod-hierarchy>Submod Hierarchy</h3><pre tabindex=0><code>Medieval II: Total War

</code></pre><p>The latest version of the mod released was version <strong>3</strong> on the <em>10th January 2026</em>.</p><div class=testimonials><h3 id=testimonials>Testimonials</h3><div class=speechbubble>I've played for several hours, with different factions. like North Dunedain, Mordor, Erebor and Kazhadum, All Elvish factions, Ar Adunaim (Personal favorite) , Dorwinion, Rhun, Dale, Gondor, and Anduin (most dificult and a pain in the ass)<p>All i can say is that AGO is a awsome addition to DAC, which was having almost no new content regarding and upgrade in gameplay.</p><p>Beside the campaign being way longer then the original DAC, it&rsquo;s not boring, every turn something is happening in the borders of your kingdom, some ocasional raids from enemies factions. bandits, or some diplomats or allies coming to your aid.</p><p>You can sense the difference between the settlements now, Castles are way important from a military perspective, since they can recruit way faster then cities, and cities are just the bulk of the economy.</p><p>Many times i was desperate to hold off some place with a castle so i can focus on developing the cities to get an economic boost. but the AI knows what is doing in this game, they play dirty, some times i was with an army close to an city and ready to do a siege, when i attacked, they also attacked at the same time one of my settlements that was ungarded.
I immediatly set off the siege and turned back to face this attack, i lost the city, but i recuperated with my army.</p><p>This happened a lot, when i tought i&rsquo;ve had the upperhand against the AI, i got blasted right back, in some unnexpected manner.</p><p>Every faction is unique in its playing style.
Elves are fierce, comparing to some other units Elves are almost heroes, but they are low on numbers and can&rsquo;t muster a big army without a big economy hit.
Dwarvs are Strong, almost as Elves, they have numbers, they are not so pricy, but they are slow&mldr; and don&rsquo;t have acces to cavalry.</p><p>Overall, excellent mod!!!</p><div class=username>TeacherH</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I've played the majority of possible mods and submods since Third Age came out. Ago is the one I like the most. Looking forward to an autonomous V3 and to seeing that, thank you for the work.<div class=username>Zoka</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I played DAC since v3, played v5 too with every faction and I recently started playing AGO and I must say that it’s a way better experience. You feel like more inside middle earth thanks to the amazing job on the soundtracks and scripts. Factions are doing a more lore accurate expansion, you can’t cheese the AI with diplomacy anymore. So for someone who’s searching something more realistic and lore accurate this is the mod. For me it’ll be only AGO for now on. Exited to play v3.<p>Thank you guys</p><div class=username>Blasux</div></div><div class=speechbubble>After yet another long hiatus from TATW and my inevitable return to it afterwards, I used the last few days to try and compare DAC AGO, with DAC Vanilla and DAC EUR and and just wanted to say AGO still feels like it's miles ahead of the others in terms of campaign feel. I don't know what exactly it is but overall it just feels so much more fleshed out whereas the others tend to have a somewhat gimmicky feel. Also, after AGO it's really rough to imagine going back to Barracks events etc. Thanks very much for this mod and the countless hours of fun it provides.<div class=username>avion3885</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I have 1000s of hours on Divide and Conquer and I just discovered AGO last week! I just wanted to take the time to thank everyone working on the mod! It's quiet a master piece and i'm enjoying it a lot! Thank you guys a lot for the hard work!<div class=username>petitpoucet</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The level of dedication to this great game and modset, on top of the love for LOTR, I couldn't be happier I stumbled onto this project. I'm not sure I can go back to different versions of Third Age: Total War at this rate, it's AGO or bust moving forward for me. This mod is peak and we're spoiled rotten to have it.<div class=username>TinyTim</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to say the fully-upgraded RK Dunedain tree units (specifically, the Dol Amroth upgrades) look terrific. I was skeptical when I saw the unit card, but was really impressed when I saw the units on the battle map.<div class=username>martingale</div></div><div class=speechbubble>You guys are amazing. I was just telling my wife how much I love this and how much effort has gone in. I thought I'd tell you all too.<div class=username>joycey17</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I played AGO as much in the last three weeks as if it were an important project in a job. With a gap of more than two years you notice also the development of the mods in detail. Therefore, all of my campaigns were immersive, exciting and stable (not one battle chrash btw), the Middle-Earth atmosphere is simply captured in a great way and the potential of a story is awakened.<div class=username>Saalpeter</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanna say I'm playing AA and the rohan units with the AA colours look amazing, Like the royal guard but AA colours looks so damn good<div class=username>Hello There</div></div><div class=speechbubble>So I just wanted to thank you all for this amazing mod, I'm not new to this at all but I just realized I never took the time to give you some feedback. I think this mod is absolutely amazing, there are few games I can get so many hours in without getting bored. I think everyone who works on this mod is incredibly talented and please don't stop working on it anytime soon<div class=username>titan1523</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Hey guys just wanted to thank you for the mod, been playing the hell out of it since I took the time to sink my teeth in it and it's just great<div class=username>blackbird</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just started a campaign with Dunland, and absolutely terrific job with the soundtrack! I got goosebumps listening to one of the tunes<div class=username>Naitheg</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Wonderful mod, any problems I had where quickly solved by either Fynn or the community<div class=username>BarrZ</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The new custom battle screen is dope af<div class=username>Tasorodri</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Brother this mod is so beautiful Im so addicted 2 it such a good submod<div class=username>SHQP465</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Sir, what an amazing mod of an amazing mod. I salute you.<div class=username>Rincewind</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to stop in and say this is a great mod, I've been playing DaC off and on since it came out years ago and AGO has been a great experience. Thanks!<div class=username>Krys</div></div><div class=speechbubble>The RK and AA remodels are both exquisite.<div class=username>Toe-Knee</div></div><div class=speechbubble>I just love the new Ring Script! It always annoyed me that in the vanilla DaC Mod, Isengard wasnt capable as an AI to obtain the Ring. But AGO just made it all more interesting. It can be destroyed from good factions, every faciton can be corrupted and keep it, evil factions give it to Sauron and isengard and their allies give it to Saruman. I am impressed!<div class=username>GOTisbestAnime</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Just wanted to say Ive started a Rangers of the north campaign and just the first 10 turns so far but the story and script direction makes so much more sense now! Really enjoying it so far!<div class=username>Crackers</div></div><div class=speechbubble>Playing a KD expedition campaign and I'm having an amazing time because of AGO.<p>In particular, the recruitment rates feel like I&rsquo;m relying on dwarves traveling to the spearhead I&rsquo;ve made into the misty mountains. Every new unit feels desperately needed and smart use of the units I do have is the only thing keeping me alive.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve nailed the unique situation the KD found themselves in the movie and book. Surrounded by wealth but lacking the manpower needed to leverage it.</p><div class=username>Noahqshark</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></body></html>
