### Description
"Clap! Snap! the black crack! Grip, grab! Pinch, nab! And down, down to Goblin-town You go, my lad! Clash, crash! Crush, smash! Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground! Ho, ho! my lad! Swish, smack! Whip crack! Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk, While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, Round and round far underground Below, my lad!" - Goblin prisoner song 

### Campaign Features
- **Dwarven Expedition (V3)**
  - Balin's Expedition is determined to retake Moria from your control. They are not guaranteed to attack you but they have stopped to prepare in Erui, East of Moria for their assault on Moria. You may decide to hold them off or attack them first but they will continue to take back Moria until they are destroyed.

- **Sauron's Will (V3)**
  - As an instrument of the Dark Lord Sauron, you start with an Inquisitor from Mordor and can recruit Black Uruk units from a few cities. Sauron also wants you to capture and sack various capitals of the Free Peoples. If you sack at least two of them and you have an alliance with Sauron, you will be able to recruit Sauron's Will from your barracks. If you sack at least three of them, you will be able to recruit Troll Catapults. If you sack all four of them, you will be able to recruit Olog-Hai. Each time you sack a settlement, your kings purse will increase.

- **Rise of the Goblins (V3)**
  - Take control of the Misty Mountains for all goblins and drive out the orcs of Gundabad and the stinkin Dwarves! Capture and hold Moria East, Moria West, Zagh Khala, Mt. Gundabad, Gorathul and Goblin Town to be able to become the 'Goblins of the Misty Mountains' and construct a unique building in the Misty Mountains.
