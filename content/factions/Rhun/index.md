"The Easterlings were strong and war-hardened and asked for no quarter... In the meanwhile the Wainriders plotted their revenge. Beyond the reach of the arms of Gondor in lands east of the Sea of Rhûn from which no tidings came to its Kings, their kinsfolk spread and multiplied, and they were eager for conquests and booty and filled with hatred of Gondor which stood in their way. It was long, however, before they moved" - Easterlings hatred
