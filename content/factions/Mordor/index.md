### Description
"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, Ash nazg thrakatulûk! agh burzum-ishi krimpatul." - Ring inscription

### Campaign Features
- **The One Ring (V3)**  
  - Send out your spies and the Nazgûl to find and return the One Ring. Bring Middle-earth to it's knees. Rule them all.. 

- **Shadow of the East**  
  - If you maintain your alliances with Khand, Rhûn and Harad, you have the oppurtunity to recruit some of their better units.

- **The Nine Nazgûl**  
  - You don't have access to all the Nazgûl at the start of the game. They will slowly return to Mordor during the campaign. If they die, they will continously respawn every 15 turns after they were killed. If Dol Guldur dies you get their Nazgûl as well. If Saruman claims the One Ring, the Nazgûl will slowly leave to serve him instead.
