### Description
"But there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose friends ... knew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long ago. ... Bard took the lead [after the attack on Laketown], and ordered things as he wished, ... he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most of them would have perished in the winter ... But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood..." - Wisdom of Bard and fortunes of Dale
