### Description
In times long past and ill-remembered, shrouded in legend and mystery, the black tower was ruled by the Númenóreans. Today, it is held by the Wise One. Saruman. He sends us greetings, and gifts of blade and shield to our Gurach's hall.
He wishes to be our friend, so his emissaries claim, and sees the great injustices done to us by the Forgoil as debt in dire need of repayment.

The men that bring his word are of the Isendraich, a tribe of mix-bloods that dwell around and even inside his walls. They are keen-minded and knowledgeable, and make for good advisors to any Brehin, and the Gurach too. In exchange for sword and shield and wisdom, Saruman asks only that we send him our warriors to fight in Rohan, and for him to be allowed to build places where his followers can dwell, and our warriors can come to be equipped.

The Brehins rejoice at this. It is what our men would do anyway, so why not take the steel to simply do what we do, but with better tools? They may not be wrong. The Huntsmasters grumble, though. They say the Wise One uses his silver tongue to make us think he wishes only for our strength, when truly he hungers for our spirit. They say they won’t offer their guidance to Brehins that allow the White Hands banner to fly next to their Crebain.

### Campaign Events

  - Saruman desperately needs you and your people to execute his plan. There are many in Dunland who wish to keep the old ways and many who want to see a new future for their people.

### Testimonials
*After now playing 4 factions in Eriador and getting to see Dunland with their unique generals, descriptions, buildings and shitty-quality roster, I wanted to say how, although not my favorite, it might be the best (most fun) faction in the mod in my opinion. 

It's just so unique with the raiding/looting barracks-system and Isengard's influence script. The latter adds what all factions - except the reworked Dorwinion and the Reunited Kingdom - need: longevity. I didn't get to interact too much with it when I played them since my campaigns end soon, but seeing Dunland getting unique Isendraich generals and Uruks reminded me of how the Isengard's influence lasts the whole campaign with It's multiple choices and tiers, while the culture change through guilds is a very subtle and fun way of implementing it realistically, adding a very needed increment to the roster at the cost of public order, although that leaves the Dunhird side an inferior choice.

Like Dorwinion's regentsmen reforms, Dunland's unlocking of higher tier settlements (no idea if that's been removed) and usage of Rohan's (which also unlocks Dunforgoil) and other, nearby factions rosters gives a big purpose and sense of progression towards your immediate enemies.

Even the fucking trash, worse-than-goblins roster is fun to use, because, even while smeared in shit, it's diverse, rewarding and varied, all the while feeling unique amongst other wildmen, with bad archers, bad AP, bad melee, bad cav and bad anti-cav, but the replenishment and manpower is just right and you have all the tools to go to war, face adversity, have fun (even while losing) and win.

Dunland is a near-perfect faction and I had fun playing it. I hope more factions get the love it got. I didn't say this before, but great work to everyone involved!
