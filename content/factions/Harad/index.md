### Description
"The Haradrim, a great and cruel people that dwelt in the wide lands south of Mordor beyond the mouths of Anduin.... a grim folk, and not easily daunted by shade or blade. Out of Far Harad black men like half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues." - Little known information on Harad

### Campaign Features
- **Unite the Clans**
  - Rise from the glittering city of Faen'obel and assert your control over the various tribes of Harad.
- **Hasharii Assassins (V3)**
  - After consolidating control of the tribes, send the assassins of the Hasharii to remove your enemies from their seats of power
- **Empire of the Haradwaith (V3)**
  - Lay claim to more than just Faen'obel and the surrounding regions and declare yourself Serpent-King, supreme ruler of the southern multitude. Forming the Empire of the Haradwaith will change your faction's colours, names and give you a small bonus to your king's purse.
- **Sauron's Will (V3)**
  - Sauron will not rest until the West is undone and you are an instrument of this reckoning. Capture key Gondorian and Amrothian cities such as Pelargir, Dol Amroth and Minas Tirith to unlock unique buildings and recieve Black Numenorean generals from Sauron.
- **The Black Pearl (V3)**
  - The Serpent-Lord has long looked across the Haradwaith in envy of independant lords that have held Umbar. It is a disgrace to the God-king Sauron for it not to be held by his people so we must take it for him. By conquering Umbar, you can build two unique buildings there as well as gain benefits from a multitude of unique landmark buildings across the Haradwaith.
