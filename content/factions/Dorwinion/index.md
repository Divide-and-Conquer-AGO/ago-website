### Description
"The heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion... a land of vines in 'the burning South.'" - Little known information on Dorwinion

The land of Dorwinion has always fascinated its many visitors. It has been described as a most beautiful flower, captivating the eye and soul alike. Smooth hills, bountiful earth and rich grapevines that grow in abundance. It is said that if a seed is planted in Dorwinion's soil, it will bloom thrice as plentiful as anywhere else. Truly, this land is Middle-Earth's garden.

At first this realm of plenty was held by the Elves of old, as all lands were, once. After them came the men that one day would be known as the ancestors of the Horse Lords of Rohan, arriving as mere cattle herding nomads. After that, yet still ages ago, the Numenoreans settled on the shores of the lands of wine, and they deeply appreciated the rich earth. They built an outpost there, gathering tribute and drafting skilled Rhovanionite horsemen for wars in far-off lands. Yet even they eventually left, leaving behind buildings of stone and some children with a sliver of Dunedain heritage.

Following them were the savage Wainriders, and they held dominion over the wine-lands for generations, until they too disappeared, either within the bloodlines of the nascent Dorwinrim or across the distant horizon.
Each tribe, visitor and nation sought to control and shape the land. Yet each of them left in turn, but not ere leaving a mark of their own, adding to the lands unique profile. Akin to foreign branches being grafted onto an ever-growing tree, different fruits nurtured by the same roots. With much time and even more hardship, the men of these bountiful lands developed a shared identity, culminating in the formation of the Vintner Court. They gave themselves laws, and a shared purpose. And so, in this Age, the fruits of these lands are manifold and their tale is yet to be told.

The Darïtaï of Rhûn to our East have been unusually quiet as of late and many of our experienced advisors suspect they prepare for all out war. We would do well to negotiate some kind of guaranteed peace with them or send out messengers to the West in search of allies. There's a mighty storm brewing across the Sea of Rhûn and make no mistake, it's coming for us...
